Instructions:
To get scala working on my laptop, I made sure to install the most recent Oracle JDK (Java 11) and installed scala with one of the sdks from the scala official site. (v 2.12.2)
I didn't have SBT or IntelliJ, so this method was by far the fastest to get started

After installing the JDK and Scala, I just ran "scalac project.scala" in the command prompt (directory set to project directory) to compile and
"scala dict" to run the program.
